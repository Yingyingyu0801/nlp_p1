      "I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago ! I was very pleasantly surprised , as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway , and he usually picks bad places-haha . Anyway , the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated . It was busy and the line was a little long , but it moved quickly . The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good , especially since it seemed to be near full . The room was clean and spacious ( especially considering it 's a city hotel ) . We made a lot of use of the concierge , since again , it was so last minute we did n't really make any plans . He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! It was also great being near the theater district , and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare . I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room ! very trendy . My husband is not as easily impressed , but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon . Overall , really nice stay in a four star , or probably four and half star hotel !\n",

      "For a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor ( think Motel 6 at a Hilton price ) . Carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin . They are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks , so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of . For the prices they charge ( $ 350.average price for two people ) . It seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby , which was happening while I stayed , could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms . But I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests , which I wo n't be .\n",
